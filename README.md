# Automatic-Number-Plate-Recognition-ANPR-System
1. Vehicle Detection : A live camera detects an approaching vehicle.
2. Capture Number Plate Image: The system captures the number plate once the
vehicle enters the detection zone.
3. OCR for Number Extraction: The system processes the captured image and
extracts the registration number using OCR.
4. Data Storage: Both the number plate image and extracted registration number are
saved to the database or Excel file.
5. Duplicate Check: The system checks if the number plate has already been recorded
to avoid duplicate entries for the same vehicle.
